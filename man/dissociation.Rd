\arguments{
\item{ctrl.mean.x}{Mean of the control group for the first test.}

\item{ctrl.sd.x}{Standard deviation of the control group for the first test.}

\item{ctrl.mean.y}{Mean of the control group for the second test.}

\item{ctrl.sd.y}{Standard deviation of the control group for the second test.}

\item{ctrl.r.xy}{Correlation between the two tests in the control group.}

\item{ctrl.n}{Integer value representing the sample size of the control
group.}

\item{score.x}{Test score of the individual case for the first test.}

\item{score.y}{Test score of the individual case for the second test.}

\item{direction.x}{Specifies the expected direction for the first test score.
Use "lower" if a lower score indicates worse performance or "higher" if a
higher score indicates worse performance (default: "lower").}

\item{direction.y}{Specifies the expected direction for the second test score.
Use "lower" if a lower score indicates worse performance or "higher" if a
higher score indicates worse performance (default: "lower").}

\item{tail}{Character. Specifies whether the test is one-tailed or
two-tailed. Options are "one.tailed" and "two.tailed" (default)}

\item{test.names}{A vector of two strings representing the names of the tests
(default is c("X", "Y")).}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level (default is 0.95 for 95\%).}

\item{dp}{Number of decimal places for rounding the results (default is 2).}

\item{deficit_method}{Character. Method for the deficit analysis. Options are 't' for frequentist t-test and 'bayes' for Bayesian analysis.}

\item{discrep_method}{Character. Method for the discrepancy analysis. Default is 'rsdt' (revised standardized difference test).}
}
\value{
A list containing the results of the dissociation analysis. Key outputs include:
\itemize{
\item \code{x.res} and \code{y.res}: Results for each test score, including t-values, p-values, effect sizes, and abnormality percentages.
\item \code{discrepancy.res}: Results of a discrepancy analysis between the two test scores (if applicable).
}
}
\description{
This function assesses dissociations between two test scores (X and Y) compared to control data.
It helps determine if a single case's scores on two tests are abnormally divergent relative to a control sample.
Both frequentist (t-test) and Bayesian approaches are available for analysis.
