\title{Compare Stability Methods}
\arguments{
\item{t1.score}{Scores of the first test.}

\item{t2.score}{Scores of the second test.}

\item{norm.t1.mean}{Mean of the normative sample at time 1.}

\item{norm.t1.sd}{Standard deviation of the normative sample at time 1.}

\item{norm.t2.mean}{Mean of the normative sample at time 2.}

\item{norm.t2.sd}{Standard deviation of the normative sample at time 2.}

\item{norm.r}{Reliability of the normative sample.}

\item{norm.n}{Sample size of the normative sample.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for stability assessment.}

\item{methods}{A character vector specifying which methods to calculate.
Default is "all" methods.}

\description{
This function compares stability methods given the scores of two tests.
