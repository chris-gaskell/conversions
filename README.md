Your overview of the neuropsytools R package is clear and concise, but here are some suggestions to enhance it further:

Overview
neuropsytools is an R package designed with clinical neuropsychology in mind. However, its utility extends beyond neuropsychologists, catering to a broader audience of clinicians and academics frequently working with psychometric tests.

Currently, neuropsytools offers a range of functions including:

Standardized Score Conversion: Convert between various standardized test scores (e.g., z-scores, index scores, T-scores, percentiles).
Dissociation Assessment: Evaluate dissociations between different cognitive functions.
Reliable Change Index (RCI): Assess statistically reliable change between two time points.
Extended Neuropsychological Testing: Additional functions to enhance the interpretation of common neuropsychological tests.
Visualization: A variety of plotting functions to visualize test scores effectively.
Many functions within this package are inspired by or adapted from existing software and methodologies. We encourage users to acknowledge the original developers by citing the appropriate references. We have made efforts to include all relevant citations, and we welcome any corrections or additions.
